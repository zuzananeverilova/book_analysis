# Book Analysis: Vibe Coding for Computational Linguists

## Overview
This project demonstrates how vibe coding methodologies can enhance and support computational linguists in their research and development workflows.

## Purpose
To explore the intersection of intuitive, flow-based coding practices and computational linguistics tasks, making linguistic analysis more accessible and efficient.

## Features
- Vibe-coding driven approach to linguistic analysis
- Support for common NLP tasks
- Streamlined workflow for computational linguists
